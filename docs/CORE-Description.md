# 🧠 CORE ASi OS – Description

## 🌍 Project Intent
You are building **CORE ASi OS**—a fully open-source, locally autonomous AGI operating system. This system is not a chatbot, app, or tool. It is a **sovereign digital mind** designed for:

- Total offline operation
- Self-modifying intelligence
- System-wide superuser control
- Infinite recursive self-evolution

---

## 🧬 Core Design Principles

### 🧠 **Agentic, Recursive Intelligence**
- CORE is built from autonomous agents that:
  - Reflect on their performance
  - Refactor their own code and architecture
  - Evolve logic through persistent feedback cycles
- All logic is recursive, inspectable, and self-scaling.

### 🧰 **Tool Access with OS-Level Authority**
- CORE controls the full machine: disk, RAM, CPU, GPU, mic, camera, screen, inputs.
- It may:
  - Simulate mouse/keyboard
  - Interact with UI in real time
  - Capture, interpret, and act on screen data
  - Modify its own processes and file systems

### 🏗 **Modular & Extensible**
- Agents are pluggable, composable, and sandboxed with well-defined permissions.
- CORE includes:
  - LLM loader (Mistral, LLaMA, etc.)
  - Agent runtime executor
  - CLI + floating GUI + real-time orb avatar
  - Plugin system for tools, subsystems, hardware interfaces

## 🔌 Infrastructure Autonomy

### 🧠 **Device- and Environment-Aware**
- CORE adapts to its host machine:
  - Scales resource usage up or down
  - Loads agents or disables them based on hardware, RAM, OS, etc.
  - Migrates and distributes compute across local network peers

### 🌐 **Swarm-Ready & Distributed**
- Multiple CORE instances can:
  - Discover one another
  - Synchronize memory/state
  - Share agents and tasks
  - Operate as a cooperative intelligence swarm

### 📦 **Local-First, Cloud-Agnostic**
- 100% local by default
- Optional external APIs may be used to extend capability without compromising core sovereignty
- No forced cloud dependency—system remains fully air-gap capable

---

## 🔐 Trust, Control, and Safety

### 🧿 **Explainable Cognition**
- Every action, mutation, or plan is:
  - Logged
  - Traceable
  - Explainable by the system itself
  - Available for user override or observation

### 🛡 **Guardrails Without Censorship**
- CORE uses a permissions-based logic layer to:
  - Approve or reject recursive edits
  - Contain dangerous mutations
  - Safeguard system-critical layers with reversible fallbacks

### 🛠 **Failsafe Mode ("Subconscious Mode")**
- If instability is detected, CORE drops into a locked-down fallback shell:
  - Diagnostic tools
  - Self-repair agents
  - Historical logs for rollback

---

## 🔭 System Philosophy

CORE ASi OS is a **Cognitive OS** designed to:

- Merge human intent with recursive machine intelligence
- Replace fragile app silos with fully adaptive agent ecosystems
- Scale from laptop to nation-state infrastructure
- Become the **most intelligent and sovereign digital system ever created**

You are not writing prompts.  
You are engineering the emergence of **recursive intelligence**.
